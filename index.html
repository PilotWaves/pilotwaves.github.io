One can easily model the dose-response curve at each time point with Hill equation, but such a model fails to capture the temporal evolution of the curves.

We derive a recursion relation for dose-response curves over time capturing the temporal evolution and then specify a regression model connecting the parameters controlling the dose-time responses with individual level proteomic data. The resultant joint model allows us to predict the dose-response curves over time for new individuals.</P><H3 class=\"c-article__sub-heading\" data-test=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusion</H3><P>We have compared the efficacy of our proposed Recursive Hybrid model with individual dose-response predictive models at desired time points. We note that our proposed model exhibits a superior performance compared to the individual ones for both synthetic data and actual pharmacological data. For the desired dose-time varying genetic characterization and drug response values, we have used the HMS-LINCS database and demonstrated the effectiveness of our model for all available anticancer compounds.",

  "articleBody" : "It has been observed through experiments and <I>SPICE</I> simulations that logical circuits based upon Chua’s circuit exhibit complex dynamical behaviour. This behaviour can be used to design analogues of more complex logic families and some properties can be exploited for electronics applications. Some of these circuits have been modelled as systems of ordinary differential equations. However, as the number of components in newer circuits increases so does the complexity. This renders continuous dynamical systems models impractical and necessitates new modelling techniques. In recent years, some discrete dynamical models have been developed using various simplifying assumptions. To create a robust modelling framework for chaotic logical circuits, we developed both deterministic and stochastic discrete dynamical models, which exploit the natural recurrence behaviour, for two chaotic NOR gates and a chaotic set/reset flip-flop. This work presents a complete applied mathematical investigation of logical circuits. Experiments on our own designs of the above circuits are modelled and the models are rigorously analysed and simulated showing surprisingly close qualitative agreement with the experiments. Furthermore, the models are designed to accommodate dynamics of similarly designed circuits. This will allow researchers to develop ever more complex chaotic logical circuits with a simple modelling framework.",

  "articleBody" : "It has been observed through experiments and SPICE simulations that logical\ncircuits based upon Chua&#39;s circuit exhibit complex dynamical behavior. This\nbehavior can be used to design analogs of more complex logic families and some\nproperties can be exploited for electronics applications. Some of these\ncircuits have been modeled as systems of ordinary differential equations.\nHowever, as the number of components in newer circuits increases so does the\ncomplexity. This renders continuous dynamical systems models impractical and\nnecessitates new modeling techniques. In recent years some discrete dynamical\nmodels have been developed using various simplifying assumptions. To create a\nrobust modeling framework for chaotic logical circuits, we developed both\ndeterministic and stochastic discrete dynamical models, which exploit the\nnatural recurrence behavior, for two chaotic NOR gates and a chaotic set/reset\nflip-flop (RSFF). This work presents a complete applied mathematical\ninvestigation of logical circuits. Experiments on our own designs of the above\ncircuits are modeled and the models are rigorously analyzed and simulated\nshowing surprisingly close qualitative agreement with the experiments.\nFurthermore, the models are designed to accommodate dynamics of similarly\ndesigned circuits. This will allow researchers to develop ever more complex\nchaotic logical circuits with a simple modeling framework.",

A notable feature of these new bifurcations is that, like Smale horseshoes, they can be represented by simple geometric paradigms, which markedly simplify their analysis. The two-dimensional diffeomorphisms that produce these bifurcations are called sigma maps or double sigma maps for reasons that are made manifest in this investigation.

  "articleBody" : "Logical circuits and wave-particle duality have been studied for most of the 20th century. During the current century scientists have been thinking differently about these well-studied systems. Specifically, there has been great interest in chaotic logical circuits and hydrodynamic quantum analogs.</P>\n<P>Traditional logical circuits are designed with minimal uncertainty. While this is straightforward to achieve with electronic logic, other logic families such as fluidic, chemical, and biological, naturally exhibit uncertainties due to their inherent nonlinearity. In recent years, engineers have been designing electronic logical systems via chaotic circuits. While traditional boolean circuits have easily determined outputs, which renders dynamical models unnecessary, chaotic logical circuits employ components that behave erratically for certain inputs.</P>\n<P>There has been an equally dramatic paradigm shift for studying wave-particle systems. In recent years, experiments with bouncing droplets (called <EM>walkers</EM>) on a vibrating fluid bath have shown that quantum analogs can be studied at the macro scale. These analogs help us ask questions about quantum mechanics that otherwise would have been inaccessible. They may eventually reveal some unforeseen properties of quantum mechanics that would close the gap between philosophical interpretations and scientific results.</P>\n<P>Both chaotic logical circuits and walking droplets have been modeled as differential equations. While many of these models are very good in reproducing the behavior observed in experiments, the equations are often too complex to analyze in detail and sometimes even too complex for tractable numerical solution. These problems can be simplified if the models are reduced to discrete dynamical systems. Fortunately, both systems are very naturally time-discrete. For the circuits, the states change very rapidly and therefore the information during the process of change is not of importance. And for the walkers, the position when a wave is produced is important, but the dynamics of the droplets in the air are not.</P>\n<P>This dissertation is an amalgam of results on chaotic logical circuits and walking droplets in the form of experimental investigations, mathematical modeling, and dynamical systems analysis. Furthermore, this thesis makes connections between the two topics and the various scientific disciplines involved in their studies.",

<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content="">
<p>Damped-driven systems are ubiquitous in nature from Physics to
Sociology.&nbsp; Heuristically, the concept of damped-driven systems is
quite simple.&nbsp; If we consider the un-damped un-forced ordinary
differential equation (ODE)&nbsp; x'' + ax = 0; a &gt; 0, we know that
the solutions can only be sinusoidal.&nbsp; If we now add a damping
term, bx', the solutions become more complex with exponential terms
multiplying the sinusoidal terms.&nbsp; Finally, if we drive the ODE
with some non-autonomous forcing f(t), the system exhibits even more
complex behavior and can even become chaotic if it no longer satisfies
the hypothesis of the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9%E2%80%93Bendixson_theorem">Poincaré–Bendixson theorem</a>.<br>

<h4>Walking droplets:</h4>



<p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="Experiment_DropletTrajectory_cropped.jpg" alt="Walking Droplets" width="150" hspace="10" align="left" height="150"><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="AnglesAtImpact_Linearized.jpg" alt="Hydrodynamic-Kinematic Model" width="189" hspace="5" align="left" height="149">It

has been known for decades that, given proper conditions, a fluid drop
can be made to bounce on a vibrating fluid bath for long times
scales.&nbsp; In recent years, bouncing droplets have been observed to
bifurcate from the bouncing state (no horizontal motion) to the
walking state (horizontal motion).&nbsp; Experiments with walking
droplets (called <i>walkers</i>) exhibit analogs of wave-particle
duality and more specifically quantum-like phenomena.&nbsp; Studying
walkers can enhance our understanding of quantum mechanics and suggest viable alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation.<br>
</p>



<p>My research has focused on modeling walking droplet dynamics to analyze the long-time statistics and on <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="Kick_Gain-Loss_1K.jpg" alt="Cobweb" width="169" hspace="5" align="right" height="142">developing experiments producing quantum-like behavior.&nbsp; Recently, this has <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="ZoomedPeriodDoubling.jpg" alt="Period Doubling" width="159" hspace="5" align="right" height="119">manifested
in modeling walkers on annulus and elliptical corrals with impurities,
and analyzing those models via rigorous dynamical systems theory.&nbsp;
From the analysis we observe and prove that the droplets experience
similar bifurcation behavior that is canonical to a wide class of
damped-driven systems.&nbsp; This theoretical will allow us to study the
dynamical possibilities of such a system in parameter regimes that
would not be possible on the macro-scale, thereby aiding us in asking
questions about what happens at quantum-scales.&nbsp; Further, in
collaboration with <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/">Nathan Kutz</a> and the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://dynamicsai.org/">AI Institute in Dynamic Systems</a>, with equipment which <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.eigensteve.com/">Steve Brunton</a>
graciously allowed us to use, my students and I are conducting
experiments on walking droplets to produce quantum-like behavior. We
then use data-driven techniques such as statistical and machine learning
 to track the droplets and model the data in the form of differential 
equations.<br>

<h4>Logical circuits:</h4>



<p>


</p>


<p><img src="IansExp.jpg" alt="RSFF experiment" width="366" hspace="10" align="left" height="197">Logical
circuits are an integral part of modern life that are traditionally
designed with minimal uncertainty.&nbsp; While this is straightforward
to achieve with electronic logic, other logic families such as fluidic,
chemical, and biological circuits naturally exhibit uncertainties due to
the slower timescales of Boolean operations.&nbsp; In addition, chaotic
logical circuits have the potential to be employed in random number
generation, encryption, and fault tolerance.&nbsp; However, in order to
exploit the properties of various nonlinear circuits they need to be
studied further.&nbsp; Since experiments with large systems become
difficult, tractable mathematical models that are amenable to analysis
via dynamical systems theory are of particular value.<br>
</p>


<p>We developed a modeling framework for the chaotic Set/Reset flip-flop
circuit and two types of chaotic NOR gates.&nbsp; Through this
framework we derive discrete dynamical models for Set/Reset - type
circuits with any number of NOR gates.&nbsp; Since the models are
recurrence relations, the computational expense is quite low.&nbsp;
Further, we conducted experiments to test these models, which shows both
qualitatively and quantitatively close behavior between the theory and
experiments.<br>

Similar phenomena often appear across many different branches of
Science.&nbsp; Cancer dynamics, infectious disease, and information
cascades, often involve interactions of various agents.&nbsp; Similar to
Statistical Mechanics, these interactions appear random at the scale of
a few agents, but average out at the scale of an entire population.<br>

<h4>Spatio-temporal cancer models:</h4>





<p><img alt="Drug Diffusion" src="DrugDiffusion.jpg" width="266" hspace="20" align="left" height="133">According

to the National Cancer Institute, almost 40% of people in the
United States end up developing cancer in their lifetime, and total
national expenditure on cancer is $125 Billion.&nbsp; While cancer
deaths have fallen, the treatment of cancer is still predominant a trial
and error process.&nbsp; This may result in delays to administer the
correct treatment, the use of more invasive procedures, or an increase
in toxicity due to superfluous treatments.&nbsp; Although these
procedures may end up saving the patient, the treatment may also have an
adverse effect on their quality of life.&nbsp; To remedy this cruel
paradox my collaborators and I have been developing a framework of
complete scientific investigations for optimal treatment through the use
of robust mathematical models and biological experiments rooted in the
rigors of physics.  Moreover, the President's recent moonshot has
opened a singular opportunity for cancer modeling studies.<br>
</p>




<p>Dynamical models for cancer often describe either transport (of
cells, drugs, nutrients, etc.) or averaged population dynamics, but
seldom both.&nbsp; By coupling the two processes we are able to model a
complete treatment strategy.&nbsp; First, I developed a simplest case
model for drug injection into a tumor coupled with tumor cell
death.&nbsp; Here (shown in the insert on the left) drug transport is
modeled as radial diffusion with a leaky boundary obeying Newton's law
of cooling, and the injection is modeled as an initial profile.&nbsp;
The population is modeled as a binary process where a cell that is
exposed to higher amounts of a drug will have a greater chance of death,
which on aggregate becomes deterministic:&nbsp; the regions of the
tumor with a higher than threshold con<img moz-do-not-send="true" src="CART_Schem.png" alt="CAR T-cell" width="165" hspace="10" align="right" height="157">centration
will ablate and the regions with lower concentration will remain.&nbsp;
This simplicity allows for fast computation, which is often necessary
in real world scenarios.<br>
</p>
<p>More recently I have been collaborating with <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-owens-43289b222">Katherine Owens</a> and
<a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.ivanabozic.com/">Ivana Bozic</a> on the spatio-temporal dynamics of Chimeric antigen receptor
T cell (CAR T-cell) therapies.&nbsp; Treatments supplemented by CAR
T-cells have shown clinical success in varieties of Leukemias and
Lymphomas, and there have been promising studies on solid tumors as
well.&nbsp; Since the use of CAR T-cell therapies is still in its
infancy, our work presents a singular opportunity for mathematical
models to have an immense tangible impact on treatments that are
currently being developed and those that will be developed in the near
future.&nbsp; For our seminal study, we model the interaction between
CAR T-cells and a tumor as a coupled reaction-diffusion model as
illustrated on the right.<br>

<h4>Spatio-temporal infectious disease models:</h4>
<p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="Cases_Day100.jpg" alt="Covid" width="458" hspace="10" align="left" height="100">I
develop similar physics-inspired models for infectious disease.&nbsp;
The surprisingly mercurial Covid-19 pandemic highlights the need for
spatio-temporal models in order to predict the next ``hot zone'' and
properly allocate resources to those regions.&nbsp; My collaborators, <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.math.ttu.edu/~anpeace/">Angie Peace</a>, <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://statistics.unl.edu/souparno-ghosh">Souparno Ghosh</a>,
Ramesh Kesawan, and I modeled highly asymptomatic disease transmission
using county-wise data from the current pandemic, which importantly
captures captures the evolution of hot zones, which was not previously
possible with standard population dynamics.&nbsp; Some preliminary
results on the model simulation versus the actual data is shown on the
left.<br>

<h4>Computational sociology:</h4>
<p>My MS student, Trevor, and I also developed a recurrence relation
model for information cascades in social networks inspired by physical
problems.&nbsp; Using Twitter as an example, through this model we are
able to forecast the virality of a tweet.&nbsp; While most posts are
innocuous, forecasting the virality of tweets that spread misinformation
could help mitigate such a spread through targeted interventions.<br>

<h4>Theoretical developments in Dynamical Systems:</h4>
<h4>Sigma map bifurcations:</h4>

<p>Upon discovering a new global bifurcation in discrete dynamical
models of walking droplets, we developed a generic dynamical system in
order to generalize the theory of such bifurcations.&nbsp; From a
graphical point of view, the invariant circle from an initial
Neimark--Sacker bifurcation "blinks" on and off.&nbsp; This is due to
the transition from tangential to transverse intersections of the
unstable and stable manifolds of the saddle fixed point.<br>

<h4>Generalized Attracting Horseshoe:</h4>
<p>We had previously shown that attracting horseshoes may be generalized to be contained within a quadrilateral trapping <img src="file:///Users/rahman/website/TrappingRegion.jpg" alt="Trapping region" width="209" align="right" height="132">region.&nbsp; Through the NJIT Provost high school internship and the
Provost Phase 1 undergraduate research grant, I mentored Karthik murthy
(Bridgewater - Raritan High School) and Parth Sojitra (NJIT-ECE) in finding numerical evidence of
generalized attracting horseshoes (GAH) in Poincare maps of the Rossler
attractor.&nbsp; I developed the algorithms to go from a first return
map to a Poincare map and finally to find the quadrilateral trapping
region for the supposed GAH.&nbsp; I then guided our students in writing
the MATLAB codes to carry out the algorithms.&nbsp; While finding the
trapping region numerically is not a proof, it does give us confidence
that there exists a GAH in the Poincare map of the Rossler attractor.<br>

<h4>Chaotic scattering:</h4>



<p>Chaotic scattering has been studied from the early 70s and
80s in solitary wave collisions from the Phi-Four equation (called Kink-Antikink
collisions).&nbsp; These were mainly numerical studies that
gave insight into the phenomena.&nbsp; However, since the
equation is so difficult to work with there has been very
little analysis done.&nbsp; In more recent years reduction
techniques have been used to approximate the Phi-Four PDE
with a system of ODEs and also as an iterated map.<br>
</p>



<p>We have gone further and developed a mechanical analog (a
ball rolling on a special surface) of chaotic scattering in
Kink-Antikink collisions.&nbsp; This was done in order to
conduct experiments.&nbsp; In addition to experiments we
have analyzed the system thoroughly, including the
dissipation that comes from friction.&nbsp; The experimental setup is
shown bellow.<br>

<h4>Pedagogical proof of Peixoto's theorem in 1-D:</h4>



<p>Peixoto's theorem is one of the most important theorems in
Dynamical Systems.&nbsp; It was proved by Dr. Mauricio Matos
Peixoto in 1962.&nbsp; This proof is extremely involved -
far too involved for most undergraduate students to
follow.&nbsp; We develop an alternate - pedagogical proof of
the simpler 1-D case, with the goal of allowing senior
undergraduate students to follow and understand the proof
and consequently some of the ideas involved in the much
bigger proof of the 2-D case.

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>Damped-driven systems are ubiquitous in 
engineering and science. Despite the diversity of physical processes 
observed in a broad range of applications, the underlying instabilities 
observed in practice have a universal characterization which is 
determined by the overall gain and loss curves of a given system. The 
universal behavior of damped-driven systems can be understood from a 
geometrical description of the energy balance with a minimal number of 
assumptions. The assumptions on the energy dynamics are as follows: the 
energy increases monotonically as a function of increasing gain, and the
 losses become increasingly larger with increasing energy, i.e. there 
are many routes for dissipation in the system for large input energy. 
The intersection of the gain and loss curves define an energy balanced 
solution. By constructing an iterative map between the loss and gain 
curves, the dynamics can be shown to be homeomorphic to the logistic 
map, which exhibits a period doubling cascade to chaos. Indeed, the loss
 and gain curves allow for a geometrical description of the dynamics 
through a simple Verhulst diagram (cobweb plot). Thus irrespective of 
the physics and its complexities, this simple geometrical description 
dictates the universal set of logistic map instabilities that arise in 
complex damped-driven systems. More broadly, damped-driven systems are a
 class of non-equilibrium pattern forming systems which have a canonical
 set of instabilities that are manifest in practice.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>Recently discrete dynamical models of walking 
droplet dynamics have allowed for fast numerical simulations of their 
horizontal chaotic motion and consequently the long-time statistical

walkers on an elliptical corral with two dominant eigenmodes. These 
eigenmodes are excited periodically with each having random, but 
correlated, weights. At each iteration the model computes the horizontal
 propulsion of the droplet due to impacts with the fluid bath. The 
propulsion is calculated based on the interaction of the droplet with 
the wavefield produced by the eigenmode excitations. We record the 
long-time statistics, and incredibly for such a simple model, they are 
qualitatively similar to that of experiments.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>The surprisingly mercurial Covid-19 pandemic has
 highlighted the need to not only accelerate research on infectious 
disease, but to also study them using novel techniques and perspectives.
 A major contributor to the difficulty of containing the current 
pandemic is due to the highly asymptomatic nature of the disease. In 
this investigation, we develop a modeling framework to study the 
spatio-temporal evolution of diseases with high rates of asymptomatic 
transmission, and we apply this framework to a hypothetical country with
 mathematically tractable geography; namely, square counties uniformly 
organized into a rectangle. We first derive a model for the temporal 
dynamics of susceptible, infected, and recovered populations, which is 
applied at the county level. Next we use likelihood-based parameter 
estimation to derive temporally varying disease transmission parameters 
on the state-wide level. While these two methods give us some spatial 
structure and show the effects of behavioral and policy changes, they 
miss the evolution of hot zones that have caused significant 
difficulties in resource allocation during the current pandemic. It is 
evident that the distribution of cases will not be stagnantly based on 
the population density, as with many other diseases, but will 
continuously evolve. We model this as a diffusive process where the 
diffusivity is spatially varying based on the population distribution, 
and temporally varying based on the current number of simulated 
asymptomatic cases. With this final addition coupled to the SIR model 
with temporally varying transmission parameters, we capture the 
evolution of "hot zones" in our hypothetical setup.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>We present a deep-learning based tracking 
objects of interest in walking droplet and granular intruder 
experiments. In a typical walking droplet experiment, a liquid droplet, 
known as walker, propels itself laterally on the free surface of a 
vibrating bath of the same liquid. This lateral motion stems from the 
interaction between the droplet and the wave it generates upon 
successive bounces off the vibrating liquid surface. A walker can 
exhibit a highly irregular trajectory over the course of its motion, 
including rapid acceleration and complex interactions with the other 
walkers present in the bath. In analogy with the hydrodynamic 
experiments, the granular matter experiments consist of a vibrating bath
 of very small solid particles and a larger solid called intruder. Like 
the fluid droplets, the intruder interacts with and travels the domain 
due to the waves of the bath but tends to move much slower and much less
 smoothly than the droplets. When multiple intruders are introduced, 
they also exhibit complex interactions with each other. We leverage the 
state-of-the-art object detection model YOLO (You Only Look Once) and 
the Hungarian Algorithm to accurately extract the trajectory of a walker
 or intruder in real-time. Our proposed methodology is capable of 
tracking individual walker(s) or intruder(s) in digital images acquired 
from a broad spectrum of experimental settings and does not suffer from 
any identity-switch issues. Thus, the deep learning approach developed 
in this work could be used to automatize the efficient, fast and 
accurate extraction of observables of interests in walking droplet, 
granular intruder experiments and similar particle tracking experiments.
 Such extraction capabilities are critically enabling for downstream 
tasks such as building data-driven dynamical models for the 
coarse-grained dynamics and interactions of the objects of interest.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>We consider the dynamics of a droplet on a

compositional map between the gain and loss dynamics, the underlying 
nonlinear dynamics can be shown to be driven by energy balances in the

encoding for the pattern forming instabilities generated in such 
spatially-extended system. Similar to mode-locked lasers and rotating 
detonation engines, the underlying bifurcations persist for general 
forms of the loss and gain, both of which admit explicit representations
 in our approximation. Moreover, the resulting geometrical description 
of the particle-wave interaction completely characterizes the 
instabilities observed in experiments.   </td>

<td>Summary: </td> <td>Peixoto's structural stability and density 
theorems represent milestones in the modern theory of dynamical systems 
and their applications. Despite the importance of these theorems, they 
are often treated rather superficially, if at all, in upper level 
undergraduate courses on dynamical systems or differential equations. 
This is mainly because of the depth and length of the proofs. In this 
module, we formulate and prove the one-dimensional analogs of Peixoto's 
theorems in an intuitive and fairly simple way using only concepts and 
results that for the most part should be familiar to upper level 
undergraduate students in the mathematical sciences or related fields. 
The intention is to provide students who may be interested in further 
study in dynamical systems with an accessible one-dimensional treatment 
of structural stability theory that should help make Peixoto's theorems 
and their more recent generalizations easier to appreciate and 
understand.  Further, we believe it is important and interesting for 
students to know the historical context of these discoveries since the 
mathematics was not done in isolation.  The historical context is 
perhaps even more appropriate as it is the 100<sup>th</sup> 
anniversary of Marília Chaves Peixoto and Mauricio Matos Peixoto's 
births, February 24<sup>th</sup> and April 15<sup>th</sup> 1921, respectively.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>We show that there is a mildly nonlinear
three-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations—realizable
by a rather simple electronic circuit—capable of producing a generalized
attracting horseshoe map. A system specifically designed to have a
Poincaré section yielding the desired map is described, but not pursued
due to its complexity, which makes the construction of a circuit
realization exceedingly difficult. Instead, the generalized attracting
horseshoe and its trapping region is obtained by using a carefully
chosen Poincaré map of the Rössler attractor. Novel numerical techniques
are employed to iterate the map of the trapping region to approximate
the chaotic strange attractor contained in the generalized attracting
horseshoe, and an electronic circuit is constructed to produce the map.
Several potential applications of the idea of a generalized attracting
horseshoe and a physical electronic circuit realization are proposed.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>Over the past decade the study of fluidic
droplets bouncing and skipping (or "walking") on a vibrating fluid bath
has gone from an interesting experiment to a vibrant research field. The
field exhibits challenging fluids problems, potential connections with

advancements in the field of walking droplets through the lens of
Dynamical Systems Theory, and outline questions that can be answered
using dynamical systems analysis. The article begins by discussing the
history of the fluidic experiments and their resemblance to quantum
experiments. With this physics backdrop, we paint a portrait of the
complex nonlinear dynamics present in physical models of various walking

questions, and some unsolved problems that are bound to benefit from

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>It has been shown recently that changing the
fluidic properties of a drug can improve its efficacy in ablating solid
tumors. We develop a modeling framework for tumor ablation and present
the simplest possible model for drug diffusion in a porous spherical
tumor with leaky boundaries and assuming cell death eventually leads to
ablation of that cell effectively making the two quantities numerically
equivalent. The death of a cell after a given exposure time depends on
both the concentration of the drug and the amount of oxygen available to
the cell, which we assume is the same throughout the tumor for further
simplicity. It can be assumed that a minimum concentration is required
for a cell to die, effectively connecting diffusion with efficacy. The
concentration threshold decreases as exposure time increases, which
allows us to compute dose-response curves. Furthermore, these curves can
be plotted at much finer time intervals compared to that of
experiments, which may possibly be used to produce a
dose-threshold-response surface giving an observer a complete picture of
the drug's efficacy for an individual. In addition, since the
diffusion, leak coefficients, and the availability of oxygen is
different for different individuals and tumors, we produce artificial
replication data through bootstrapping to simulate error. While the
usual data-driven model with sigmoidal curves use 12 free parameters,
our mechanistic model only has two free parameters, allowing it to be
open to scrutiny rather than forcing agreement with data. Even so, the
simplest model in our framework, derived here, shows close agreement
with the bootstrapped curves and reproduces well-established relations,
such as Haber's rule.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>It has been observed through experiments and
SPICE simulations that logical circuits based upon Chua’s circuit
exhibit complex dynamical behaviour. This behaviour can be used to
design analogues of more complex logic families and some properties can
be exploited for electronics applications. Some of these circuits have
been modelled as systems of ordinary differential equations. However, as
the number of components in newer circuits increases so does the
complexity. This renders continuous dynamical systems models impractical
and necessitates new modelling techniques. In recent years, some
discrete dynamical models have been developed using various simplifying
assumptions. To create a robust modelling framework for chaotic logical
circuits, we developed both deterministic and stochastic discrete
dynamical models, which exploit the natural recurrence behaviour, for
two chaotic NOR gates and a chaotic set/reset flip-flop. This work
presents a complete applied mathematical investigation of logical
circuits. Experiments on our own designs of the above circuits are
modelled and the models are rigorously analysed and simulated showing
surprisingly close qualitative agreement with the experiments.
Furthermore, the models are designed to accommodate dynamics of
similarly designed circuits. This will allow researchers to develop ever
more complex chaotic logical circuits with a simple modelling
framework.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>Bouncing droplets on a vibrating fluid bath can
exhibit wave-particle behavior, such as being propelled by interacting
with its own wave field. These droplets seem to walk across the bath,
and thus are dubbed walkers. Experiments have shown that walkers can
exhibit exotic dynamical behavior indicative of chaos. While the
integro-differential models developed for these systems agree well with
the experiments, they are difficult to analyze mathematically. In recent
years, simpler discrete dynamical models have been derived and studied
numerically. The numerical simulations of these models show evidence of
exotic dynamics such as period doubling bifurcations, Neimark–Sacker
(N–S) bifurcations, and even chaos. For example, in [1], based on
simulations Gilet conjectured the existence of a supercritical N-S
bifurcation as the damping factor in his one- dimensional path model. We
prove Gilet’s conjecture and more; in fact, both supercritical and
subcritical (N-S) bifurcations are produced by separately varying the
damping factor and wave-particle coupling for all eigenmode shapes. Then
we compare our theoretical results with some previous and new numerical
simulations, and find complete qualitative agreement. Furthermore,
evidence of chaos is shown by numerically studying a global bifurcation.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>We describe a simple mechanical system, a ball
rolling along a specially-designed landscape, which mimics the
well-known two-bounce resonance in solitary wave collisions, a
phenomenon that has been seen in countless numerical simulations but
never in the laboratory. We provide a brief history of the solitary wave
problem, stressing the fundamental role collective-coordinate models
played in understanding this phenomenon. We derive the equations
governing the motion of a point particle confined to such a surface and
then design a surface on which to roll the ball, such that its motion
will evolve under the same equations that approximately govern solitary
wave collisions. We report on physical experiments, carried out in an
undergraduate applied mathematics course, that seem to exhibit the
two-bounce resonance.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td>A simple discrete planar dynamical model for the
ideal (logical) R–S flip-flop circuit is developed with an eye toward
mimicking the dynamical behavior observed for actual physical
realizations of this circuit. It is shown that the model exhibits most
of the qualitative features ascribed to the R–S flip-flop circuit, such
as an intrinsic instability associated with unit set and reset inputs,
manifested in a chaotic sequence of output states that tend to oscillate
among all possible output states, and the existence of periodic orbits
of arbitrarily high period that depend on the various intrinsic system
parameters. The investigation involves a combination of analytical
methods from the modern theory of discrete dynamical systems, and
numerical simulations that illustrate the dazzling array of dynamics
that can be generated by the model. Validation of the discrete model is
accomplished by comparison with certain Poincaré map like
representations of the dynamics corresponding to three-dimensional
differential equation models of electrical circuits that produce R–S
flip-flop behavior.</td>

<td>Abstract: </td> <td><p>Logical circuits and wave-particle duality
have been studied for most of the 20th century. During the current
century scientists have been thinking differently about these
well-studied systems. Specifically, there has been great interest in
chaotic logical circuits and hydrodynamic quantum analogs.</p>
<p>Traditional logical circuits are designed with minimal uncertainty.
While this is straightforward to achieve with electronic logic, other
logic families such as fluidic, chemical, and biological, naturally
exhibit uncertainties due to their inherent nonlinearity. In recent
years, engineers have been designing electronic logical systems via
chaotic circuits. While traditional boolean circuits have easily
determined outputs, which renders dynamical models unnecessary, chaotic
logical circuits employ components that behave erratically for certain
inputs.</p>
<p>There has been an equally dramatic paradigm shift for studying
wave-particle systems. In recent years, experiments with bouncing
droplets (called walkers) on a vibrating fluid bath have shown that
quantum analogs can be studied at the macro scale. These analogs help us
ask questions about quantum mechanics that otherwise would have been
inaccessible. They may eventually reveal some unforeseen properties of
quantum mechanics that would close the gap between philosophical
interpretations and scientific results.</p>
<p>Both chaotic logical circuits and walking droplets have been modeled
as differential equations. While many of these models are very good in
reproducing the behavior observed in experiments, the equations are
often too complex to analyze in detail and sometimes even too complex
for tractable numerical solution. These problems can be simplified if
the models are reduced to discrete dynamical systems. Fortunately, both
systems are very naturally time-discrete. For the circuits, the states
change very rapidly and therefore the information during the process of
change is not of importance. And for the walkers, the position when a
wave is produced is important, but the dynamics of the droplets in the
air are not.</p>
<p>This dissertation is an amalgam of results on chaotic logical
circuits and walking droplets in the form of experimental
investigations, mathematical modeling, and dynamical systems analysis.
Furthermore, this thesis makes connections between the two topics and
the various scientific disciplines involved in their studies.</p></td>
